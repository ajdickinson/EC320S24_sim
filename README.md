# Monte Carlo Simulation (EC320S24)

The following repository contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulation assignment for EC320S24. This in class assignment is to simulate the sampling distribution for OLS and compare it to an alternative. The code is written in R and the simulation is done in an RMarkdown document. The structure of this repository is described in the following diagram:
