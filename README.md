# Monte Carlo Simulation (EC320S24)

The following repository contains the code for the Monte Carlo simulation assignment for EC320S24. This in class assignment is to simulate the sampling distribution for OLS and compare it to an alternative. The code is written in R and the simulation is done in an RMarkdown document. The structure of this repository is described in the following diagram:

└── README.md
```

To get started, download the zip file from green code button on the top right corner of the repository. Unzip the file and open the R project file `EC320S24_sim.Rproj`. This will open the project in RStudio. Open the RMarkdown file `babysteps_sim.Rmd` and compile the document to see if everything is working.
